# 2qubit_PRB
We execute randomized benchmarking in 2 qubit channel.
main file :
execute rb and fit and polt
preparation file :
generate gateset data and Clifford data

#===========================================

rb_seq:
gate number is 1 to 100
repeat number is 1000
2-qubit depolarizing: 
p to do nothing
1-p to totally mixed state (I, X, Y, Z)^2
2-qubit dephasing:
p to do nothing
1-p to totally dephasing (I, Z)^2
